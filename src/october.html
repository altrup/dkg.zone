            <h1>About October Optics</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">
                I (Spencer, creator of October Optics) have been obsessed with Halloween and the lights that come with it for most of my life. When I was around 5 years old, I started helping my mom with decorating the house each year. When I would go to my grandparents’ house, we would always go on walks to see who had the best decorations. As time would go on, my love for Halloween would grow. This brings us to 2020, the year of "containment", which led to a lot of reminiscing and idea forming, especially for me. I became very interested in nostalgia, which would mix with my love for Halloween. As a result of this, I began collecting decorations, which would branch into even more Halloweeny Hobbies. Looking for old Halloween related media online, learning about the different types of decorations, when they came and gone, keeping in touch with my own memories of past Halloweens, and much more.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">
                But along with reminiscing comes the realization of change. In this case, I began to notice that Halloween has seemed to be passing its golden years. Hence, October Optics. This is my effort to boost the culture of Halloween and everything related to it. So, no matter the size of the job, or reason you need us, we’d love to help. Seeing each and every house on a street decorated would be a dream come true.
